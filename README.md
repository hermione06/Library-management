Bookshop Management System

This C code provides users with a bookshop management system, which includes various procedures such as adding, displaying, renting, returning, searching, deleting books, determining the bestsellers, updating details, managing sales and
rentals. It’s connected to a database, so all the details are being added and updated there.

Databases:
‘book.txt’ file -  It's like a digital bookshelf storing details about added books, such as title, author, genre, price, quantities.

‘sale.txt’ file - This file records sold books, including details like title, author, genre, price, and quantities of sales, acting as a sales ledger.

‘rent.txt’ file - Like 'sale.txt', but for rented books. It keeps track of borrowed books, rental days, quantities aiding in inventory management for libraries and rental services.
